Welcome to my first forray into the world of machine learning and image recognition. This all started in the summer of 2023 when I first learned about the different types of car bodies (e.g. Sedan, SUV, Vans, Hatchbacks, etc.). I wondered how cool it would be if I could 
create a program that could do all of this for me. And this is the brainchild of that little idea. With the help of the dataset provided [here](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mayurmahurkar/stanford-car-body-type-data?resource=download) and the help of this [tutorial](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2021/07/step-by-step-guide-for-image-classification-on-custom-datasets/)
I was able to create a simple CNN that can take an image of a vehicle and accurately predict what body type it is. Below are some snapshots of the program working as intended: 


Here are the three images that I used to verify the results of my program
![cab](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c60c7d13-0615-4383-a117-e13961a8b423) <br>
This is a Cab body type


![hatchback](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ca554c05-bd7f-4c9f-93d2-9622d47d72c3)
This is a Hatchback body type 

![sedan](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3eb0658a-d686-4f39-91dc-7f1affd32623)
This is a Sedan body type

And these are the results from the program: 
![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/45d1f94e-3390-4cc1-a826-dd410e6155c2)
The results are in the same order as the images in the folder (alphabetical)

That's pretty much it, I have some further plans for this project, either a way to count the number of cars of each type for a camera feed of a random intersection, bonus points if the camera feed is of some place that I frequent, or if I am able to get my hands on one, 
a Raspberry Pi which interfaces with a camera that I will be wearing which will then keep track of the number of each type of car bodies I see on a walkaround of my neighbourhood/on my way to the gym/running erands. I may inevitably end up doing both, but inspiration will 
determine which one I do both. 

Thank you, and I look forward to what other cool stuff I can come up with.
